What better way to create an effortlessly drinkable dark beer than to make it nitro. The resulting creaminess and smooth mouthfeel balance perfectly with the subtle roasted notes of coffee and chocolate. The beer brings together the rich history and heritage of London Porters, with the modern techniques of brewing nitro beers. The result is a beer that is easy drinking, without sacrificing its character.","abv":"4.4","name":"London Black","bar":null}],"notes":"London est. 2013","location":"London"}]}
